TechnoArt
=========

/**
 * A TechnoArt panel is a drawing surface on which the user can
 * sketch curves.  The class has a createMenuBar() method that can
 * be used to get a menu bar containing drawing commands and options.
 * It has a main() routine that enables the class to be run as a
 * standalone application; the program just opens a window that 
 * shows a TechnoArt panel and its menu bar.
 * 
 * The real point of this example is to demonstrate ArrayList.
